  Pretty much equivalent to an explicitly called destructor in C++, or a Drop trait in Rust.
  often paired with defer blocks, to emulate a nice 'RAII' _type behaviour.

  recursive is defaulted to true. we set a precedent that this is the expected behaviour when calling destroy in most cases;
  every subobject that needs to be freed, will be.

  if you pass false, say to a List!<T>, where T implements Destroy,
  the destroy function will not call destroy on the objects in the list.
